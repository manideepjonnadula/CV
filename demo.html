			<h1>Welcome to Ocean of Details</h1>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Thanks for providing me this opportunity.
			As you know, <i>I’m <b>Jonnadula Yaswanth Manideep</b> and completed B.Tech from Vignan’s Lara Institute of Technology and Sciences in Mechanical Engineering</i> Stream with an aggregate of 8.1.
			I have done well throughout my academics. 
			I came from a <b>nuclear family</b>. 
			I consider myself as a practical and enthusiastic person towards the latest technological advancements.
			My strengths are Communication and Presentation Skills, Cross-functional skills and Quick learnability. 
			Being from the Mechanical Engineering stream, I do not have a great technical caliber.
			However, I started exploring Software Development Life Cycles, C, Python and HTML.
		As I’m a quick learner, I don’t feel my Engineering stream won’t be an obstacle but provides the required Domain knowledge.</p>
